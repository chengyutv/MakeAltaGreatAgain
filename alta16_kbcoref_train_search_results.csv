Scott Israel was elected Sheriff of Broward County in November 2012. Upon taking office he redirected the Broward Sheriff's Office mission to focus on fighting violent crime, keeping Broward's youth out of jail, and addressed the special needs of disadvantaged members of our community, including the homeless and mentally ill.

As a result of the Sheriff's initiatives, crimes - including violent offenses - are sharply down, and juvenile arrests have decreased through the implementation of the civil citation program. Broward County is safer and more united as a result of Sheriff Israel's leadership and community outreach initiatives. He understands that by working with community partners and neighbors, we can make the Broward Sheriff's Office the kind of world-class law enforcement organization it should be.

Sheriff Israel spent the first 25 years of his law enforcement career with the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. He was known for his unique ability to develop working relationships with individuals and various community organizations. He retired from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department as Commander of their S.W.A.T. Team, Homeland Security Director and Captain of Community Policing.

In July of 2004, he was appointed as the Chief of Police for the City of North Bay Village. As the Police Chief, he was honored in 2005 by the Miami-Dade County Police Benevolent Association as ""Police Chief of the Year.""

Scott Israel is a member of the National and Florida Sheriff's Association, Broward County Chiefs of Police Association, the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force and Violent Crime and Drug Control Council. In 2013, he was honored as the ""Man of the Year"" by the Shomrim Society and ""Democrat of the Year"" from the Broward County Democratic Party.

Scott Israel holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science from Cortland State University and is a graduate of the FBI National Academy. He and his wife Susan are the proud parents of triplets.

I’m currently crossing over into an IT career but my background is in science with several degrees. Most recently I worked in customer service which taught me a lot about teamwork, record keeping, and time management. My past educational and science based work experience has taught me how to be detail oriented, a critical thinker, and a fast learner. While my education and work has played a role in shaping who I am today, I’ve always loved computers.

I grew up with computers, starting with Windows 3.1 and DOS, built several gaming computers as I got older, and have always been the “IT” guy for family and friends troubleshooting any problems they had. Up until recently most of my computer knowledge was self taught but I have been attending Centriq which is providing me the skills, training, and certification I need to get my foot in the door and transition into an IT career.

My background is in management and communication consulting with formal training in business coaching. My corporate experience includes 3M Company, MCI, Towers Perrin and Dentsply. As a consultant, I worked with a number of clients in a variety of industries on projects that include marketing & communication strategy, social media, process design & organization, and training & development.

In early 2013 I embraced Google Plus. (Google Plus is Google, and the first place Google searches.) I negotiated the formidable learning curve and now help businesses to do the same. I emphasize Google hangout strategies and using video for internal and external communication.

Of all my communication skills, I rely most on my ability to listen – to hear what YOU need. If you're not sure what you need or where to start, my approach is to ask all the right questions. The best answers will come from you, the person who knows your business better than anyone else. You provide the ideas, I provide the drive.

My sense of urgency never wanes. Time management and productivity are constant priorities, and my greatest strength.

Specialties: Google Hangouts, communication strategy and project management. Every project starts with a comprehensive strategy, including well-defined objectives, a time line, and metrics to track effectiveness and ROI.

State-of-the-art communication and social media technology are an integral part of all my projects.

The purpose of education is to pass down the greatest elements of our civilization to posterity and to train future generations in the skills to maintain and further intellectual, cultural, scientific, religious, and social progress.

What are the greatest elements of my civilization? Inquisitiveness, Idealism, Cooperation, Faith, Perseverance, Individuality, Problem Solving, and a Desire to create a better tomorrow.

The chief way to achieve this stated purpose of education is to develop the intellectual character of our students, and therefore the intellectual character of society. While disseminating information has its place in education, in the modern world of hyper-connectivity, it is becoming increasingly less necessary because electronic devices make this information available within the press of a few buttons. The challenge then is to teach students how to process, synthesize, critique, and use highly accessible information.

Education is not a one-way street. The teacher does not hold all knowledge about our subject. I want every student to be comfortable enough to add to our discourse. I value participation more than correct answers. I am a firm believer that wrong answers teach more than right ones, and they teach exponentially more than silence. Wrong answers can expose underlying problems of understanding, faulty logic, and even inadequate teaching methods. By continually giving our students an opportunity to share and add to our discussions, we can evaluate what they know and how well we are doing at teaching them. This open format also gives the other students a chance to correct and teach each other.

In my school we explore ideas, events, language, and texts. This exploration leads to discovery by the students, and discovery is the teaching. Exploration is the process of introducing and inducing questions for the students to answer. Education

I built Cincy 360 Fitness based around my belief that in order to achieve maximum results you must assess every factor of a client’s life and utilize multiple facets of fitness. It is this approach to fitness, my drive to reach seemingly unattainable results, and my passion for continuing to learn that enables my clients to reach their fitness goals. I am a certified personal trainer through International Sports Science (ISSA) and National Foundation of Personal Trainers (NFPT). I am also certified through PTA Global and will be completing another certification through the National Strength and Conditioning Association in 2014. Personal training is one of the most rewarding careers out there. I love to see clients come in on day one, not knowing if they will ever see the results that they are envisioning and watch them achieve their goals after months of hard work. I cannot put into words the feeling I get from helping someone realize that with sweat equity, anything is possible! If you are wanting to make a positive change in your life and are ready to commit to work hard to make it possible, I will make sure that those wants turn into reality.

Myanmar National Airlines is the national flag carrier of Myanmar and has the most extensive route network within our country. Our airline has been in existence for over 65 years and we are one of the oldest and most experienced airlines in Asia.

Major change is underway as we launched our new domestic service in 2014 with fixed schedules, state of the art Reservations and Airport Systems, a brand new Premium Economy on our Embraer 190 aircraft and upgraded food and inflight service throughout our fleet.

In 2015 we start to fly International again after a break of may years providing regional jet services to neighbouring countries. This will allow Myanmar people to stretch their wings alongside us and for us to welcome many more visitors to our country.

Later in 2015 we welcome our brand new Boeing 737 aircraft into our fleet. This will allow us to expand out international network and offer an even better experience for our customers.

MNA is going places and we would like you to come along with us.

Accomplishments 
In the last 12 months I have been thrown into the deep end of a very mismanaged portfolio during an aparant unwelcomed office merge with many disgruntled landlords and tenants. During this time I have managed to satisfy a majority of landlords and tenants and have achieved this firstly by regular communication, secondly by giving honest and factual information. I have managed to sort out a gigantic mess within the system and files all the while being abused continually for at least the first four months at the same time as not letting anything else get further behind. I have achieved a great level satisfied landlords and tenants through alot of hard work and volunteered overtime. My travel time to and from properties is anywhere from 30 mins to 90 minutes which takes a lot of your day as appointments are a necessary spectrum of the position which can hinder your paperwork quickly and easily however the files are now up date with maybe a handfull on the final stages of completion

Product guy focused on disruptive products that change the way people interact and communicate with each other and discover new information. I like playing with the latest and greatest technology, but my greatest thrills come from applying that into new situations where anyone can use it without understanding the tech.

Most important is finding an amazing group of talented people to share the journey. You know you've succeeded when your neighbors tell you about the latest thing they've discovered... and you've worked on it.

I've been lucky to be a part of several of the most significant internet and social companies and led or was involved in key projects that have altered their trajectories.

Specialties: Designing consumer internet software. Product launches. Cradle to grave product lifecycle. Balancing the tradeoffs of getting it perfect and getting it out the door. Product requirements, product marketing, customer analysis. Still knows how to code a mean Windows app. Education
