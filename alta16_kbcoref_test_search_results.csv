Steven Sashen is the developer and CEO of Xero Shoes • Your Original Barefootware - www.XeroShoes.com. Steven and his wife, Lena Phoenix, started the ""Barefoot... PLUS!"" sandal business in late 2009; he had returned to sprinting 2 years earlier, at age 45, and experienced almost continuous injuries. An experiment with running barefoot cured the injuries and improved his times. Knowing about the Tarahumara indians in Mexico, who run hundreds of miles in sandals made of tire scraps lashed to their feet, Steven created a high-tech upgrade of that product and launched it online.

With nothing but Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Marketing, Xero Shoes has become the best-selling running sandal in the world.

Steven's commitment is to making footwear that lets customers connect with the ground and ""Feel The World,"" fits perfectly, express wearer's personalities, outlasts any other footwear, and uses fewer resources than any other footwear. He's also committed to discovering and teaching the best techniques for teaching natural movement -- for walking, hiking, and running.

Prior to jumping into the sandal business, Steven was an internationally-known Internet marketing expert, Search Engine and Social Media marketing consultant, and software designer. He also co-hosted the Emmy award winning, internationally syndicated TV show, Disk Doctors.

Steven is also a Masters All-American sprinter, one of the fastest 50+ year olds in the United States.

Specialties: barefoot running, SEO/SEM, marketing, meditation, turning ideas into products.

For over 25 years I have been acquiring knowledge and focusing all my talents to evolve the traditional communication campaigns towards truly effectiveness of ""enveloping plans"" of influence and persuasion.

SURRENDER YOU ARE SURROUNDED
or the omni channel fx.

- Using the media ( ATL/BTL/ON LINE/OFF LINE ) as an articulated experience of stimulus that triggers the motivators of the target audience.
- Activating their network of internal determinants that incite them to think, take decisions and act.
- Moving from creating communication for the people, to producing knowledge next to the people.
- Co-create an inherent drama and incorporate it as an active part of their demeanour.
- To essentially hack the EPH, “the emotive program to ensure happiness”, the person has as a root of his behaviour.

CREATING BELIVERS

I have successfully worked two decades within the global marketing communications agencies such as Leo Burnett, McCann Erickson World Group and Ogilvy & Mather, facing out the integral management of creativity and its strategy on all marketing disciplines, committed with a divergent and innovative perspective.

My experience includes nearly 15 years of account management in the employee benefits field. My most recent experience involved managing a book of key accounts that exceeded $1,000,000. These accounts were a broad mix of fully-insured and self-insured clients, and my experience involved all aspects of plan administration.

The service that I provided included consulting in all lines of employee benefits coverage; medical, dental, life, disability and voluntary benefits. In addition to presenting renewal and alternative plan designs, I managed the marketing process, negotiating on behalf of the client with multiple local and national medical and ancillary insurance carriers. This process included securing sold coverage, implementation and employee enrollment. On a quarterly basis, I met with clients to review claims and experience utilization and how this utilization impacted the current budget and projected renewal of the plan. I worked closely with our internal underwriting team to evaluate trends in utilization and methods of cost containment for areas of concern.

The enrollment and communication of these benefits to employees was conducted via multiple avenues, including creating written memos, employee benefit guides, webinars, online videos and in-person meetings. Beyond the scope of employee communication, I was also a day-to-day liaison for both the employer and employee in regards to benefits, claims, billing and enrollment questions and concerns.

Other areas of my role involved consulting clients in regards to ACA compliance, the employer-shared responsibility mandate and communication of the individual mandate to employees. Due to the ever-changing environment of the current industry, I was also very involved in consulting about technology solutions and wellness initiatives.

I currently hold a life/health license in the state of Minnesota, and am in the process of obtaining my CEBS designation, with the first two courses completed. Education
